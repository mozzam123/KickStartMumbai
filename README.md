# KickStart Mumbai - Tournament Management System

This project is a **Node.js** and **Express**-based application designed for managing tournaments, teams, and user accounts. It connects to a **MongoDB** database using **Mongoose** and provides functionalities for user management, team management, and tournament management.

## Key Features

- **User Management**: Create, read, and delete users with unique usernames and validation.
- **Team Management**: Create, update, delete, and retrieve teams, ensuring a minimum number of players per team.
- **Tournament Management**: Create, update, delete, and retrieve tournaments, including the ability to add teams to tournaments.
- **Data Validation**: All user inputs are validated to ensure data integrity.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: Backend JavaScript runtime.
- **Express**: Web framework for building RESTful APIs.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing users, teams, and tournaments.
- **Mongoose**: ODM library to interact with MongoDB.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd <project-directory>
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. Set up your MongoDB connection. Ensure MongoDB is running locally or provide a connection string in the `index.js` file:

    ```javascript
    mongoose.connect("mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/KickStartMumbai");
    ```

5. Start the application:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

The server will start running on `http://localhost:9999/`.

## Folder Structure

- **Controllers**: Contains business logic for users, teams, and tournaments.
- **Models**: Defines the Mongoose schemas for users, teams, and tournaments.
- **Routes**: Manages the application routing for user, team, and tournament features.

## How It Works

1. **User Interaction**:
   - Users can create an account with a unique username and password.
   - Users can manage teams and tournaments by adding, updating, and deleting them.

2. **Tournament Management**:
   - Users can create tournaments and associate teams to participate.
   - Tournaments can be updated or deleted as needed.

3. **Team Management**:
   - Teams can be created with a minimum of three players and managed effectively.

## Future Improvements

- **Authentication**: Implement user authentication for secure access, including password hashing and session management.
- **Advanced Analytics**: Add features for match statistics and analysis.
- **User Interface**: Develop a user-friendly front-end interface for better interaction with the system.
- **Integrations**: Integrate with messaging platforms for real-time tournament updates and notifications.
- **Performance Optimization**: Enhance performance by optimizing database queries and server responses.
- **API Documentation**: Improve API documentation for easier integration with other applications.
